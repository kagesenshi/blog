I noticed a package in Fedora Extras called <a href="http://geany.uvena.de/">Geany</a> while shopping through packages using synaptic .. The description says <br /><blockquote>A fast and lightweight IDE using GTK2</blockquote><br />Currently I'm using Anjuta for my assignments and course C/C++ work, but to me, Anjuta is too much for my simple day-to-day programming - which sometimes I just do it on Gedit or Vi - , so I decided to give Geany a try.  <br /><br />At first, I expected it to be a lightweight C/C++ IDE , but to my surprise after launching it, it support lots of languages~!!!!!. C/C++, Java, PHP, Bash Scripting, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc etc. And it does not only support syntax highlighting, but also a basic code completion, a basic class browser, some other simple tools , and best of all, compiling/executing the programs written despite the various languages it supports. Geany select the compilers/interpreters automatically and use it when you click the compile/execute button<br /><br />The UI is easy enough for use, simple, and effective. It does not have all those advanced project-management modules like Anjuta and Netbeans, but it have everything it needs to be an IDE for simple applications. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/RdCP1uzBZdI/AAAAAAAAABM/JIxn_8VxXTo/s1600-h/070213-01.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/RdCP1uzBZdI/AAAAAAAAABM/JIxn_8VxXTo/s320/070213-01.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5030678937030714834" /></a><br /><br />A Windows installer is also available from the official Geany site's <a href="http://geany.uvena.de/Download/Releases">downloads page</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
