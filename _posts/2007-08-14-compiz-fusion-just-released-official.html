---

I just noticed something a few minutes ago ..<br /><br />Compiz Fusion have released their official tarballs!!!!<br /><br />http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2007/08/13/compiz-fusion-our-first-release-052/<br /><br />This is nice ... guess i'll skip doing homeworks for today and tomorrow ... wanna package this thing ... homeworks can wait .. :P<br /><br />With the release of official tarballs for compiz fusion, i hope i can get it properly submitted into fedora .. (the git packages changes too much.. .thus makes me not confident to send them for review) ..<br /><br />Off I go ... ~~<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
