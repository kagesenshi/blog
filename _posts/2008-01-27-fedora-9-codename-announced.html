title: Fedora 9 Codename Announced???
---

Okay, Josh Boyer announced it @ fedora-announce-list, and the winner is Sulphur (at least from the vote results)<br /><br /><a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-January/msg00012.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-January/msg00012.html</a><br /><br />Somehow, I don't feel quite happy about the announce. Naming of Fedora releases have been running in quite a fun manner since its started going public not so long ago. The name game starts only when the next release of Fedora almost done, suggestions come, voting was made (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting">approval voting</a> - NOT the Pick-Only-One voting like the recent F9 name vote). The vote results remain secret and contributors wait anxiously for what name the winner going to be until a few days before release. And once it got official, the name got out not through announcements, but from people who saw fedora-release was changed in cvs commits!!. <br /><br />The name game and waiting for the name confirmation was somehow like a fun reward for the hard work of all people who spent their time and effort on the release. The names are not treated as a development Codenames, but as the Release names which contributors are proud of.<br /><br />Did the long lived fun <a href="http://www.redhat.com/magazine/024oct06/features/rh_speaks/">tradition</a> changed simply because somebody wanted to get names early for doing release-name related artworks?. Or was it due some other considerations?. I wonder how many other contributors feels the same.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
