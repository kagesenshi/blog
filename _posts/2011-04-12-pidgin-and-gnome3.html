title: Pidgin and GNOME3
---

GNOME3 comes with Telepathy/Empathy integration. However, I'm mainly a Pidgin user because Telepathy/Empathy lacks of per-account proxy settings. I always force my IMs to go through a proxy in VPN regardless where I am, but not for other apps, so telepathy/empathy is out of the equation.<br /><br />Anyway , pidgin users who are like me, here is a little present for y'all.<br /><br /><s><a href="http://fedorapeople.org/gitweb?p=izhar/public_git/hack-patches.git;a=tree;f=gnomeshell@pidgin.im">Pidgin GNOME3 Integration Extension</a></s><br /><br /><s>Just copy the <code>gnomeshell@pidgin.im</code> folder into your <code>~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/</code> and restart your gnome-shell. </s><br /><br />The extension utilize pidgin's dbus API, so it'll need pidgin to be running. I only did some rough test with it only on my Fedora 15 machine, but I believe it should work ok everywhere else.<br /><br />Now for me to get some sleep XD.<br /><br /><b>Update</b>: For some reason unknown to me, my git repos dissappeared from fedorapeople.org/git. The code is now hosted here: <a href="https://github.com/kagesenshi/gnome-shell-extensions-pidgin">https://github.com/kagesenshi/gnome-shell-extensions-pidgin</a>. To install, create a <code>pidgin@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org</code> directory in <code>~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions</code>, copy the 2 files into it and restart gnome-shell.
