IpV6 is a new DNS lookup that few servers use. This means that if the site you are trying to access in not listed on Ipv6, a 30 second timeout immeditately happens. It should be disabled. Also, Some other DNS servers miss the first few requests from linux machines. The default timeout is 5 seconds, so this could cause up to another 15 second delay. Step by step  fix is as follows:<br />1. Log out of Fedora<br />2. Log in as root<br />3. enter your root password (the root password you entered when you installed fedora)<br />4. Click on "Home" or "My Computer"<br />5, Click on "Filesystem" or use up arrow to navigate to etc folder.<br />6. go to resolv.conf file. (not a folder, but a file located at the end of the files in your etc folder)<br />7. Insert this line at the bottom of the file: option timeout:1<br />8. Save the file<br />9. Go to etc/modprobe.conf file. Insert these lines at the bottom of the file:<br />alias ipv6 off<br />alias net-pf-10 off<br />10. Save the file.<br />11. Reboot your machine<br />12. Enjoy the SPEED!<br /></blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
