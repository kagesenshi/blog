Around 19:00MYT (11:00GMT) today @ #fedora irc.freenode.net<br /><br /><code><br />&lt;evil_steve&gt; oh come on. THey GPL'd Sim city 48 hours ago and it's *not* packaged and in repos yet?<br />&lt;evil_steve&gt; :)<br />&lt;evil_steve&gt; and we call ourselves geeks<br />&lt;KageSenshi&gt; aah?!!<br />&lt;KageSenshi&gt; yay to gaming!<br />* KageSenshi now waits for simcity4k to GPL .. <br />&lt;evil_steve&gt; http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/01/10/simcity-source-code-released-to-the-wild-let-the-ports-begin.aspx<br />&lt;KageSenshi&gt; &gt;.&lt;<br />* KageSenshi tries to build<br />&lt;evil_steve&gt; KageSenshi: let me know how you go.<br />&lt;KageSenshi&gt; :D<br /></code><br /><br />Yay to Free/OpenSource Softwares!!. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">original SimCity</a> is now GPLv3+!. From the way it looks, I believe it was released to make it as an Activity for the OLPC XO. Nevertheless, it can be compiled and run at our normal desktop linux.<br /><br />From the guide on the link above ( which for building on VisualStudio (O.o)" ) .. Here are the RPM packages <a href="http://izhar.fedorapeople.org/MicropoliceCore/">http://izhar.fedorapeople.org/MicropoliceCore/</a>. <br /><br /><blockquote>UGLY PACKAGE ALERT!: The original tarball have some hardcoded paths and no proper automated script for installation, so I patched it with my own HACKISH patch and a HACKISH %install to make it packageable. And the launcher is a very HACKISH launcher.</blockquote><br /><br />Dont expect its playable though. I couldn't find how to run it as a game - and the Visual Studio based guide is also not yet complete, so, I totally have no clue. If anybody succeeded, can you tell me how?<br /><br />You can launch the demo run using <br /><code>/usr/bin/MicropoliceCore-launcer</code><br /><br />The original project site is at <a href="http://www.donhopkins.com/home/micropolis/">http://www.donhopkins.com/home/micropolis/</a>. There, you grab the sources for the OLPC XO version of Micropolis if you want.<br /><br />Happy hacking.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
