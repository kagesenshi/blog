<a href='https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2007-February/msg00876.html'>https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2007-February/msg00876.html</a><br /><br /><blockquote>One of the big Features of Fedora 7 is a merged core and extras.  In order to <br />accomplish this, we need some improvements to the buildsystem currently used <br />by Fedora Extras.  We need these improvements done or mostly done by the <br />Feature Freeze of Fedora 7, which was originally set to be the 20th of <br />February, 4 days from now.  It is very clear that these changes will not be <br />ready by then.<br /><br />To accomplish these changes (and others) in time for the Feature Freeze, we <br />have added another month to the schedule, introducing a Test 4, and moving <br />the Feature Freeze as well as String Freeze up to Test 3 freeze, March 19.<br /><br />This moves the general availability date from April 26 to May 24.<br /><br />For further discussion on this topic, please use the fedora-maintainers list, <br />which I am attempting to set reply-to.<br /><br />For reference: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/7/Schedule<br /><br />-- <br />Jesse Keating<br />Release Engineer: Fedora</blockquote><br /><br />If its for stability , its okay to me ..<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
