title: OSCC Mirror
---

So, at last the <a href="http://www.oscc.org.my/">Open Source Competency Center</a>, Cyberjaya _finally_ <a href="http://blog.harisfazillah.info/2008/06/mirror-at-oscc-mampu.html">have mirrors running</a>. Theres Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, ArchLinux mirrored. For the Fedora Mirror (only F9), here are the baseurls:<br /><br /><pre><br />Everything : http://mirror.oscc.org.my/fedora/releases/9/Everything/$basearch<br />Updates    : http://mirror.oscc.org.my/fedora/updates/9/$basearch/<br /></pre><br /><br />However, sadly, its only a 8Mbps mirror - rather surprising for a government-supported organization. I've asked whether they want to be in <a href="http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org">mirrors.fedoraproject.org</a> automated by-nearest-country mirrorlist reply so that the mirror can get a one nice DDoS, not sure whether they'll take that idea or not.<br /><br /><b>Update</b>: <a href="http://blog.harisfazillah.info/">Haris</a> said, he want to proceed. I hope it goes well. Yet, I don't want MirrorManager to reply list with only that OSCC mirror. Coz with 8Mbps, I doubt it can really handle it &gt;.&lt; . Hopefully, that once they get themselves in <a href="http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org">mirrors.fedoraproject.org</a> , that can be a big enough traction to push their higher ups for bigger bandwidth. I hate to admit this: only 8Mbps from a country like Malaysia, is quite embarrassing.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
