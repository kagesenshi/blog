Version 0.1 of Ks-X liveCD has been completed, i've tested it on qemu with only 128MB RAM allocated. To my surprise, the liveCD consume only 85-95MB after a clean boot!!!<br /><br />amazed with the achievement, i started wondering on how to create an installable version of this liveCD. I have tried to use anaconda, but ends up with frustation. The comps.xml file is very tedious. I only want a simple installer that acts like the Ubuntu installer, no need for customization of packages, juz install all.<br /><br />if anybody out there know how to do this, could you give me some tips to make this installer??...<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
