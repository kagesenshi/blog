title: 'HOWTO: An organized way to install programs @ your home folder'
---

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Installing stuff in linux usually requires root access .. this is true especially when the program which you want to install is a later version that the one that already installed in the system ..<br /><br />As for some people, they might not want to pollute their RPM/DEB/put-a-packaging-system-here installations with installation from source tarballs and making the system hard to maintain using their distribution's package tools<br /><br />However, it is not impossible for users to seamlessly install/upgrade programs into their own home folder, leaving the main system untouch .. you only need the program's source code , a compiler , and the development libraries ...<br /><br />NOTE: This method may work with most programs out there that uses the ./configure script, however, some applications might refuse to work in this environment.<br /><br />NOTE2: This article is targeted to people who already know their way when using linux. Its not targeted to newbies. However, I wont stop newbies from trying this. Its a good learning experience ;-)<br /><br />NOTE3: I will not be responsible to whatever damage it might cost you .. Try it at your own risk .. However, I dont think this will damage the whole system because u only work in your home folder without using root .. Normally if you do messed up, you'll only make the user unusable, just delete the user and create a new one.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Preparation</b><br /><br />Before starting to install any programs using this method, we'll need to modify some PATH settings first.<br /><br />First create these folders in your home folder : ~/bin , ~/local/ , ~/local/bin , ~/local/sbin , ~/local/etc , ~/local/opt ,  ~/local/lib , ~/local/share , ~/local/var ; These folders will be where you install your compiled programs<br /><br />Then, open ~/.bash_profile and change this line (or similar)<br /><pre><br />PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin<br /></pre><br />into this<br /><pre><br />PATH=$HOME/bin:$HOME/local/bin:$PATH<br /></pre><br />This will make the installed programs in your home folder have higher priority when executing it without full path.<br /><br />Logoff and relogin for the settings to take effect.<br /><br />Now we are done with the preparation, lets proceed in the method to install programs into your home folder<br /><br /><b>Compiling and Installing</b><br /><br />Untar the source packages into somewhere you like ( I usually untar it in ~/local/src/build/ ). Change directory into the folder and run<br /><pre><br />./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/<br />make<br />make install<br /></pre><br />This will work with programs that uses the usual procedure of this method. Some might requires some extra stuff to be done first before make. Basically , the most important part here is the --prefix=$HOME/local/<br /><br />After installation, try executing the command and check whether it works or not. For example, if you compile a new nmap, run<br /><pre><br />which nmap<br /></pre><br />if the output is  ~/local/bin/nmap , congratulations, you succeeded XD .<br /><br />If it works, you're done. And If not, you might have done something that made it doesn't work and good luck finding it ;-P<br /><br />NOTE: Some programs might need you to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib before executing the program<br /><br /><b>How about packages that comes in a standalone tarballs? Eg. Azureus</b><br /><br />Simple, just extract the tarball into ~/local/opt/ and create a symlink in ~/local/bin to the program's executables. And you're done.<br /><br />You can also create a folder ~/local/opt/bin for symlinks related to ~/local/opt programs. Just make sure you add $HOME/local/opt/bin into the PATH declaration in ~/.bash_profile<br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />Linux is a very flexible environment and a very fun one if you know how to use and manipulate it. Enjoy~~ (^-^)</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
