Something I saw at <a href="http://planet.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Planet</a> from Jeremy Katz's post <a href="http://katzj.livejournal.com/419551.html">Who says the mp3 patents aren't enforced?</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/cebit-crackdown-51-exhibitors-busted-for-patent-infringement/">CeBIT crackdown: 51 exhibitors busted for patent infringement</a><br /><br /><blockquote><br />The word is that 51 different exhibitors got busted at the show for the patent infringement, with 180 law enforcement officers confiscating 68 moving boxes worth of gear. Primary offenses included Meizu-style MP3 / MP4 infringement, along with unregistered CD, DVD-R and DVD playback devices.<br /></blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
