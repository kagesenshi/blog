title: Back to UTP
---

Another semester going to start, and yet another semester with only port 80 and 443 outbound to Internet *sigh*. <br /><br />Struggling to re-setup the IRC servers because of room changes and new admins. Also, need to update my FC6 repository mirror of Extras, Updates and Livna. The UTP Open Source society also have lots of stuff to catch up. <br /><br />Hopefully I can finish all of this by 2 weeks.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
