I am doing some development for a UN community site, using Zope/Plone. I uses Qemu for hosting the guest OS for my development environment.<br /><br />For 2 days, I keep wondering why Zope/Plone loads damn slow on the qemu machine eventhough I have allocated both cores of the processor, and 512RAM for it. 15 minutes simply to start up is really not desirable. I kept on investigating and guess what:<br /><br /><code>[root@unapcict ~]# /sbin/hdparm -t /dev/hda<br /><br />/dev/hda:<br /> Timing buffered disk reads:   18 MB in  3.03 seconds =   5.95 MB/sec</code><br /><br />Just for a comparison, the host hdd's speed:<br /><br /><code>[root@Nobuyuki ~]# /sbin/hdparm -t /dev/sdc<br /><br />/dev/sdc:<br /> Timing buffered disk reads:  174 MB in  3.01 seconds =  57.71 MB/sec</code><br /><br />Darn.. So, thats what the reason. Dear lazywebs, anybody know how to improve the speed??.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
