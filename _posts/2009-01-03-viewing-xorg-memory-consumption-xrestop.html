For some reason Xorg on my desktop was using around 1400MB virt memory after 14 days uptime. (really, it filled up all my RAM and swap).<br /><br />Asked at #fedora, and <a href="http://ivazquez.livejournal.com/">ivazquez</a> mentioned <code>xrestop</code>. And so I installed it, ran it, and walla, the culprit was gnome-screensaver with 999MB RAM consumption (wtf!?!). <br /><br />Killed it, and the RAM/Swap usage drop from 99%/99% to 44%/0%. Yay!.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
