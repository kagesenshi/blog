title: Fedora Daily Package
---

Chris Tyler just announced a blog for a daily review of Fedora packages from the default repositories. Some sort like <a href="http://debaday.debian.net/">Debian package of the day</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2007-April/msg00103.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-list/2007-April/msg00103.html</a><br /><br />Site URL: <a href="http://dailypackage.fedorabook.com">http://dailypackage.fedorabook.com</a><br /><br /><blockquote>The Fedora Daily Package is an unofficial daily guide to some of the<br />interesting and useful packages in Fedora which installed by default. A<br />new package is featured each Weekday according to daily themes, except<br />for Wednesday, when the site features an in-depth look at a Fedora<br />packaging or configuration detail.<br /><br />This is a fun and easy way to learn about new packages that you may have<br />never heard about! The Fedora daily Package is at<br /><a href="http://dailypackage.fedorabook.com">http://dailypackage.fedorabook.com</a> (Atom and RSS feeds are available).<br /><br />--<br />Chris Tyler</blockquote><br /><br />One interesting post I saw on the site is the RPM rollback capability. RPM can repackage the files installed in the computer into a .rpm file - with the new configs etc intact. Now, thats something new to me. I had never known that RPM can do such thing.<br /><br />Read more here<br /><a href="http://dailypackage.fedorabook.com/index.php?/archives/17-Wednesday-Why-Repackaging-and-Rollbacks.html">Wednesday Why: Repackaging and Rollbacks</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
