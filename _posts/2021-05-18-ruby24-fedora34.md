Fedora 34 now [ships with Ruby 3.0 by default](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Ruby_3.0), 
which might be great news for Ruby developers. However, for those who might still be relying on
older version of Ruby to run their stuff (eg: me), and don't want to spend time updating things
to make them work with Ruby 3.0 (like this Jekyll-based blog), the switch may be undesirable.

Good news, since Fedora 28, there is a lesser known feature of Fedora (and CentOS/RHEL), called
DNF Modules, which came out of the [Fedora Modularity](https://docs.pagure.org/modularity/) initiative.
DNF Modules allows you to configure your Fedora installation to track a specific version of upstream
component (eg: Ruby27, PostgreSQL 10, etc) and would only receive updates and packages that are
compatible with that version.

To switch to Ruby2.7, you can easily do it through following commands

```console

$ sudo dnf module reset ruby
$ sudo dnf module install ruby:2.7
$ sudo dnf --allowerasing distro-sync

```

After the update, you will see that your default ruby installation is now using Ruby 2.7.

For more information on DNF Modules, check out [Switching Module Streams documentation at Fedora 
Documentation site](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/using-modules-switching-streams/).
