title: An update on the ***OSCon name issue
---

Ok, I've been poking around a lot lately :P<br /><br />So an update on the trademark stuff in my <a href="http://blog.kagesenshi.org/2009/03/some-trademark-lesson-to-particular.html">previous post </a><br /><br />So, I've got some clarification from the person in charge in the ***OSCon. Here's a snippet of the mail.<br /><br /><blockquote>We are talking to O'Rilley for the use of OSCON, if they said no ahead, it will be OSCON, else we will use Conference.<br /> <br />OSDC will not appear as we have drafted - we have initiated and in the process of formalizing OSDC.my chapter - something that OSDC Club has agreed and excited about.</blockquote><br /><br />So, if they are going to properly protect the identity of the trademark, great!. Lets hope all the docs/webpages out there are properly updated soon.<br /><br />From the email it looks like they are also another process of creating an Malaysia Open Source Developer Club for a different, post-event purpose. <br /><br />Great then :D. Looking forward for more good news to tell, and bad stuff to attack. :P<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
