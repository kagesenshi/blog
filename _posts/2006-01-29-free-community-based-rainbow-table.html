title: Free Community Based Rainbow Table Cracking
---

<p>Cracking a passwd hash using the traditional JohnTheRipper way might take a very long time to accomplish ... </p>    <p>there is also an alternative and faster way of cracking ... by generating rainbow tables ( <a href="http://www.antsight.com/zsl/rainbowcrack/">http://www.antsight.com/zsl/rainbowcrack/</a> ) ... however .. this requires you to pregenerate the tables on your own first ( it may take years too ).. and it might be worthless if you only need to crack one password ..</p>    <p>but fear not ... RainbowCrack.com ( <a href="http://www.rainbowcrack.com/">http://www.rainbowcrack.com/</a> ) is here for you ... this site is a community based rainbowtable cracking engine .. the only catch is .. you need to generate a 600MB rainbowtable for them and upload it to their server.. after uploading, u are granted access to their rainbowtable cracking engine for 14days ...</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
