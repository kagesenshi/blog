When I was working with <a href="http://startifact.com/">Martijn Faassen</a>, I was introduced to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/traject">traject</a>, which is a library written by Martijn for URL routing. It is available to be used in <a href="http://grok.zope.org">Grok</a> using <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/megrok.traject">megrok.traject</a>, also by Martijn.<br /><br />From that experience, I had the idea of integrating traject with Plone content type, so that we can have neat things like:<br /><ul><li>multiple instance of SQL application, in a single site, where each instance have different database url. </li><li>Use plone as the frontend proxy to other applications, where items from that application can be accessed through plone.</li><li>Those above are my primary motivation, but who knows what else this thing might open possibility to</li></ul><br />I'm also hoping by having URL routing we make it easier for non-zope programmers to start developing stuff on Plone, as thats the common mechanism used in other Python web frameworks, and ZODB and graph traversal is something unfamiliar.<br /><br />I've uploaded the code into collective. Only tested it roughly, but it works here on my Plone 4.1 buildout.<br /><br /><a href="https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.trajectory/trunk/README.txt">https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.trajectory/trunk/README.txt</a><br /><br />Have fun hacking :D<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
