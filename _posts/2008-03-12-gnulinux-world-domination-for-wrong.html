After all, the proprietary drivers are available at no cost, just like the ethically free ones, so why not use them, especially when they are technologically more advanced? I've even seen some users castigate Fedora for not providing the proprietary drivers in its repositories.<br /><br />Never mind that to do so would be against Fedora's policy of including only free software -- with such users, the short term convenience of the technically superior proprietary drivers outweighs the ethos of freedom. Many of the complainers do not even appear to have heard of free software ideals. Nor do they bother listening when those ideals are raised. <br /></blockquote><br /><br />Fedora is a strong supporter of software freedom, and it will be for a long time to go. I am a believer of this ideal and this is one of the main reason I love Fedora. Thanks Bruce, for understanding Fedora's stand.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
