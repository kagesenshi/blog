Juz came back from a hacking competition @ UiTM Shah Alam that was held last few days. I was in one of the 2 teams representing UTP there. My team (KageSenshi & Yondenmai) can be considered a very n00bie team with no experience whatsoever about the competition and the other one is a senior team who won last year's competition (Int_13h &amp; Xumarix).<br /><br />The first day started off quite boring.. Theres a talk about WEP Cracking using Linux and thats all. On the afternoon we got nothing to do.. So, i go back to my home @ Puchong to download stuffs.<br /><br />The next day, Saturday, is the forensic competition - 10am to 5pm . Got 7 flags to collect. The questions are quite hard for my team because we dont have a clue on what software to use. UTP's teams got the lead on the first hours but we stuck starting at the middle of the game. At the end .. we could not proceed any further ... and end up with 6th place ..<br /><br />On Sunday , is the CTF challenge ... CTF is more into attacking the servers and vulnerabilities .... gladly to me .. the questions are easier for me to do .. coz most of it are sumthing that i know .. (not well known .. but atleast i know  a little bit) ... with the help of yondie googling stuff ... we strive with speed and won the second place ... and our seniors .. got the first place ... wee ...<br /><br /><br />(aa .. i'm lazy to post ... )<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
