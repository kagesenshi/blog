title: 3 days on Rawhide
---

I've been on Rawhide for almost 3 days now. So far there are no showstopper bug that prevents me to do work. The new GDM looks cool, Firefox3 is great, new System-config-firewall is great, but Xorg is a little bit scary (I've expected this problem : <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/OneSecondX">OneSecondX feature</a> brings a lot of changes into Xorg - unstability is unavoidable). <br /><br />What I can't do for now:<br />* Switch VT - I can't switch back to X after that <br />* Use Compiz/3D apps - X crashes right after starting compiz/glxgears - <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=427643">#427643</a><br />* Exit X/Logout - X could not restart<br /><br />All problem above resulted in a total lockup from physical access. Box still responding through network.<br /><br />For others, everything works fine like usual (at least for my purposes, and of course, the versions are newer than F8 versions).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
