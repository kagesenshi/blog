Fedora users in Malaysia are everywhere, but hard to find due to most of them being in their own, secluded, microcommunity. A number of small companies, government offices, organizations, have Fedora deployments in them with their own group of users, but they are hard to notice.<br /><br />Me and my comrades have just created and registered a channel in Freenode.net for our own Malaysian community. Come and join us at <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/fedora-my">#fedora-my</a> @ irc.freenode.net.<br /><br />We are also planning for a site for Fedora Malaysia in <a href="http://fedora.foss.org.my/">http://fedora.foss.org.my/</a> but our capacity is limited as all of us are quite busy with out current job. Yes, we are looking for more hands to help making this a reality.<br /><br />We are quite related to <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/myoss">#MyOSS</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com.my">Ubuntu-My</a> usergroup. Together with <a href="http://foss.org.my/">FOSS-SM</a>, we work together to spread FOSS love in Malaysia.<br /><br />All Fedora and Fedora derivatives (RHEL, CentOS, Blag, etc) users are welcomed. I'll be waiting for you. ^-^<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
