Quote from JDrama <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_%28TV_series%29">CHANGE</a>. Episode 5<br /><br /><blockquote><br /><b>Keita Asakura</b><br /><br />    I'm sorry for being arrogant. <br />    I used to be a grade school teacher.<br />    Last year,<br />    I was in charge of the fifth graders.<br />    Anyway, they fight quite often.<br />    But some of them become spiteful<br />    and then sometimes it leads to bullying.<br />    When those problems arise,<br />    I would tell them,<br />    "Let's think."<br />    "You're in the same class,<br />    so when there's something you don't like or you're not satisfied of, then tell them properly,<br />    and listen to them properly."<br />    "Then let's think thoroughly. Then..."<br /><br /><b>Gunji</b><br /><br />    They'll understand each other.<br /><br /><b>Keita Asakura</b><br /><br />    No.<br />    They'll realize that they're different.<br /><br />    Since we think we're all alike,<br />    we get mad when we get contradicted.<br />    When someone acts different, we think "What the heck?"<br />    That's when fights and bullying begin.<br />    But no two people are alike.<br />    Everyone thinks differently and has different situations.<br />    That's why I wanted them to understand<br />    that they're different from each other.<br />    After that, think of what words to use so that their feelings will reach each other<br />    and so that they can convince each other.<br /><br /></blockquote><br /><br />^.^<br /><br /><blockquote><br />O mankind, We have created you male and female, and appointed you races and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely the noblest among you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you. God is All-knowing, All-aware. (49:13)<br /></blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
