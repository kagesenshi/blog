I've wanted to post this a long time ago, but forgot. I don't really like to use paster as just installing paster for python2.4 introduce large number of external easy_install packages which are not maintained by RPM, and I dont like that as it feels intrusive. <br /><br />Furthermore, a minimal directory tree with just what needed to generate a buildout is more desirable as its easier to move around across distros and system and store in VCS rather than a big directory with files that hardcodes to system-specific paths generated from paster. <br /><br />So, this little guide will go through how to create plone buildout without using paster. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Requirements:</span><br /><br /> * install compat-python24-{setuptools,devel,imaging,elementtree} from rpmfusion<br /><br /> * <code>easy_install-2.4 zc.buildout</code><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Creating the Buildout</span><br /><br />Take the sample baseline config from the end of this post. Strip it down or add more stuff to it as you wish and put it in an empty folder. In this case, lets take for example ~/Devel/mybuildout/. So, the file would be ~/Devel/mybuildout/buildout.cfg<br /><br />Next, create some base directory tree.<br /><br /><pre>cd ~/Devel/mybuildout/<br />mkdir products src</pre><br /><br />Finally, init, and run the buildout<br /><br /><pre>buildout init<br />./bin/buildout -vvvvv</pre><br /><br />Done. You are good to go. Start zope by <code>./bin/instance start</code> and if you are following the config below, zope will be listening at http://localhost:8080 and the manager username is <code>admin</code> with password is <code>zopeadmin</code><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sample buildout.cfg (modified from the one generated by paster)</span><br /><br /><pre># buildout.cfg<br /><br />[buildout]<br />parts =<br />    plone<br />    zope2<br />    productdistros<br />    instance<br />    zopepy<br /><br /># Add additional egg download sources here. dist.plone.org contains archives<br /># of Plone packages.<br />find-links =<br />    http://dist.plone.org<br />    http://download.zope.org/ppix/<br />    http://download.zope.org/distribution/<br />    http://effbot.org/downloads<br /><br /># Add additional eggs here<br /># elementtree is required by Plone<br />eggs =<br />    elementtree<br /><br /># Reference any eggs you are developing here, one per line<br /># e.g.: develop = src/my.package<br />develop =<br /><br />[plone]<br />recipe = plone.recipe.plone>=3.1.7,<3.2dev<br /><br />[zope2]<br />recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install<br />url = ${plone:zope2-url}<br /><br /># Use this section to download additional old-style products.<br /># List any number of URLs for product tarballs under URLs (separate<br /># with whitespace, or break over several lines, with subsequent lines<br /># indented).
