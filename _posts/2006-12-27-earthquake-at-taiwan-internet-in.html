title: 'Earthquake at Taiwan : Internet in Malaysia and several south east asia countries
  down'
---

The recent Richter 7.1 earthquake in Taiwan have caused a submarine cable fault between Shantou, China and Tanshui, Taiwan and between Lantau, Hong Kong and Chongming, China. This occurrence have severely damage communication between several south-east asian countries - including Malaysia - and Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and United States.<br /><br />you can read the announcement from TMnet <a href="http://www.tm.net.my/tmnet2006/contents/corporate/news_details.cfm?id=1108&type=News&pg=1">here </a>.<br />And the news from niser <a href="http://www.niser.org.my/news/2006_12_27_01.html">here</a><br /><br />I noticed the connection became alarmingly unstable early this morning. At first I thought it was a problem within the country until one of my friend in Terengganu pm'ed me and saying the same connection instability happened there. Then I checked the TM website and saw the earthquake announcement.<br /><br />The connection was severely unstable during the morning, and gladly its becoming better as time goes. However, connections frequently timed out and interrupted a lot of my downloads and website loads. <br /><br />I hope this situation will be fixed by the time I'm back at college. If not, Its gonna be a disaster. The internet connection there is not stable to begin with. Its like having this type of earthquake a few times a week.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
