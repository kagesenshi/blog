Yesterday I was at JCKL for my weekly ninjutsu class. When I was passing by their computer lab, suddenly something caught my eyes - "Flying High" and "Fedora Bubbles" !!. <br /><br />The users (some grownups, some children) who are using the computers seems happily browsing the Internet and using OpenOffice. And they didn't look like having trouble using it. One of the children was also doing something with The GIMP!.<br /><br />Linux is spreading slowly but far, hidden from the eyes of general public (^o^). Lets keep it going!. All hail to the Penguin!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
