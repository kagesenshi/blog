title: Eaten by Rawhide
---

Got eaten by Rawhide after today update. Lots of GTK/GNOME app crashes while starting with this error (yeah, that includes 'gnome-session'). GDM not affected.<br /><br /><code><br />This probably reflects a bug in the program.<br />The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.<br />  (Details: serial 22 error_code 3 request_code 2 minor_code 0)<br />  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;<br />   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.<br />   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line<br />   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful<br />   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)<br /></code><br /><br />glad the basic KDE4 installed can run.<br /><br />Running 'rpm -Va' right now before assuming something wrong with any packages.<br /><br /><b>Update:</b><br />After reinstalling all packages that fails 'rpm -V', and downgraded some packages to the packages below, I managed to back login into GNOME. Some services like Gstreamer and gnome-settings-daemon still crashes/could not start, but at least I can get back to work. Still not sure which was the culprit.<br /><br />Downgraded:<br /><code><br />gnome-panel-2.21.91-8.fc9.i386<br />gnome-panel-libs-2.21.91-8.fc9.i386<br />gstreamer-plugins-good-0.10.6-8.fc9.i386<br />libXmu-1.0.3-5.fc9.i386<br />libgnome-2.21.90-2.fc9.i386<br />xorg-x11-drivers-7.3-1.fc9.i386<br />xorg-x11-server-Xorg-1.4.99.1-0.22.20080221.fc9.i386<br />xorg-x11-server-common-1.4.99.1-0.22.20080221.fc9.i386<br />xorg-x11-server-devel-1.4.99.1-0.22.20080221.fc9.i386<br /></code><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
