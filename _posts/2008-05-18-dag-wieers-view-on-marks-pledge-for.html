title: Dag Wieers view on Mark's pledge for synchronized release
---

Read it here: <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/blog/ubuntus-need-to-catch-a-wave">http://dag.wieers.com/blog/ubuntus-need-to-catch-a-wave</a><br /><br /><blockquote>So Mark's article is wishful thinking and hoping to ride the wave that Red Hat (and Novell) are funding. If he can use that same kernel, with the same backports, fixes and regressions tests, Ubuntu LTS does not need to do anything to support the same vendor hardware. Easy, but at the expense of both Novell and Red Hat.<br /><br />That explains why Mark wants 2 out of 3 Enterprise Linux distributions to enter his circle. I could imagine Novell and Mandrake joining forces to align the release cycle to try and take on Red Hat's 80% Enterprise Linux market share (sales, not necessarily install-base). There is hardly any benefit in Mark's proposal for Red Hat.</blockquote><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
