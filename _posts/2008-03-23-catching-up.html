Catching up on stuff that happened this week:<br /><br /><b>MAMPU Migrates Malaysian Government Agencies to OpenOffice/ODF</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.oscc.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=189&Itemid=128">MAMPU Migrates to OpenOffice.org</a><br /><br />Hooray to <a href="http://kaeru.inigo-tech.com/">kaeru</a> and <a href="http://www.oscc.org.my">OSCC</a>!. This is a great success indeed.<br /><br /><b>UTP-OSS meetup March 2008</b><br /><br />Our little special interest group in my University just held a meetup last friday. We haven't done any meetups for quite a while now and to my surprise, it looks like the number of really interested people have grown a lot. The turnout was approximately 20 people, and I can be sure at least 90% of them used linux in some point of their life and have some clue about OSS world. Compared to our previous big meetup which was mostly attended by uninformed people.<br /><br /><a href="http://rumble.yondie.org">Yondie</a> presented his presentation from the last Ubuntu meetup and I share my experience working with an <a href="http://www.inigo-tech.com/">Inigo</a> and how OSS economics works. <br /><br />IMO, this meetup was a great success and I hope those who are in UTP-OSS can continue this momentum and help building UTP-OSS reputation among UTP academician as a great knowledge-community.<br /><br />p/s: wheres our cameraman, da.blindheart???. I want the pictures!!. Upload it somewhere pls. :P<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
