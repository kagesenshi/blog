A great announcement @ Fedora-Marketing-List today<br /><a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2007-November/msg00079.html">fedora-marketing-list/2007-November/msg00079.html</a><br /><br />More to read here : <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/257559">http://lwn.net/Articles/257559</a><br /><br /><blockquote>Linking to "third party repositories": Legal says that we can link, from<br />the Fedora website, to third party repositories, so long as no one has<br />made a critical assessment to determine that a patent or patents cover<br />the technology in question and no party has actually asserted their<br />patents against the technology, we should be okay. Once we are on notice<br />of a claim of infringement or are aware of a competent assessment that<br />concludes infringement is likely, we would need to take the link down or<br />run a serious risk of facing a claim for inducing infringement.  Merely<br />linking would be highly unlikely to subject us to a claim of direct<br />infringement. I asked about MP3, and it was stated that unless we are<br />specifically aware of the MP3 patent holders asserting a claim against<br />the technology, we are still okay.<br /><br />This means that we can put a page up on the fedoraproject.org wiki,<br />which carefully explains that there is an optional addon repository<br />called Livna, which contains packages that for a variety of reasons, are<br />not included in the normal Fedora repositories. We should not specify<br />these reasons, and if someone asserted their patents against something<br />in Livna, we would need to take the page down. We can link to Livna<br />directly on this page. We cannot ship yum configs which enable Livna<br />(but Livna provides these, so we don't really need to).</blockquote><br /><br />Hooray!!!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
