A bit of a change from the usual tech posts, an anime-related post - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Geass">Code Geass</a>'s R2 final episode.<br /><br />Since <a href="http://blog.kagesenshi.org/2006/12/psalms-of-planets-eureka-seven.html">Eureka Seven</a>, its been a while that I last experienced withdrawal after a series. Throughout the 2 seasons, Code Geass have been a very enjoyable ride. The story are well written and well presented. The non-stop feeding of cliffhangers, the plot where good and evil are different based on perception, made it a very enjoyable and fun ride. <br /><br />Fact of life, everything has to end, Code Geass officially ended last week. Lelouch a.k.a Zero strategic mind, ideals and personality made it to the top of the my most-respected anime character list. And his final sacrifice .. is EPIC.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lelouch_Lamperouge">Lelouch Vi Britannia / Lelouch Lamperouge</a> , once a prince of the Holy Britannian Empire - the empire that have taken over half of the world population through military forces - seek to create a new peaceful world where his sister, Nunnaly - who was blinded and lost her walking ability when their mother was killed - could live a peaceful and happy life. A world without war, where everyone living peaceful with each other. One day he met a mysterious girl, called C.C., and was given a power to force absolute obedience - a Geass - and that power have created him a key to change the world. Under the faceless mask of Zero, he created the Order of The Black Knights to take down his father's empire and recreate the world. <br /><br />Zero Requiem: Lelouch's final masterplan of creating a new world - by directing the world's hate toward himself - to make people forget the Euphemia "Massacre Princess" tragedy, and for recreating the world. He successfully unite everyone by taking over the whole world and made the whole world hated him by being a tyrannical dictator - an act that made everyone unite under a common trait - despising the Emperor Lelouch. The closure of Zero Requiem, is he plotting his own death - bringing everyone's hatred with him, and successfully fulfilled his objective - to destroy and recreate the world.<br /><br />A bitter ending, yet sweet and memorable. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcPQ7t35XI/AAAAAAAAASw/5UnwU8drnEY/s1600-h/cg02.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcPQ7t35XI/AAAAAAAAASw/5UnwU8drnEY/s320/cg02.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253184273933395314" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcPQ-JHC_I/AAAAAAAAAS4/XK3CBH-P1O0/s1600-h/cg03.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcPQ-JHC_I/AAAAAAAAAS4/XK3CBH-P1O0/s320/cg03.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253184274584505330" /></a><br /><br />Lelouch have taken over the world, as a tyrannical dictator, and made the whole world hate him.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcPQgi8TwI/AAAAAAAAASo/BU8Froi9_pg/s1600-h/cg01.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcPQgi8TwI/AAAAAAAAASo/BU8Froi9_pg/s320/cg01.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253184266639789826" /></a><br /><br />Zero reappears, behind the mask was previously Lelouch, now, Suzaku have taken this symbol of justice.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9HgAlnI/AAAAAAAAATA/2GGwU3ekMfs/s1600-h/cg04.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9HgAlnI/AAAAAAAAATA/2GGwU3ekMfs/s320/cg04.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253186132522342002" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9I7O27I/AAAAAAAAATI/aIZqAufGDVY/s1600-h/cg05.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9I7O27I/AAAAAAAAATI/aIZqAufGDVY/s320/cg05.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253186132904958898" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9KjywEI/AAAAAAAAATQ/fOrkhKDqUNs/s1600-h/cg06.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9KjywEI/AAAAAAAAATQ/fOrkhKDqUNs/s320/cg06.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253186133343518786" /></a><br /><br />Suzaku, Lelouch's best friend since childhood, taken the honor to finish the Zero Requiem, and also taken the final wish of Lelouch, to live as Zero for the rest of his life, becoming the symbol of justice. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcae_TJ2JI/AAAAAAAAATw/-6wvLQGpfbM/s1600-h/cg10.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcae_TJ2JI/AAAAAAAAATw/-6wvLQGpfbM/s320/cg10.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253196610041141394" /></a><br /><br />Final smile before the end.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9YevXkI/AAAAAAAAATY/UhYupnG_wkA/s1600-h/cg07.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9YevXkI/AAAAAAAAATY/UhYupnG_wkA/s320/cg07.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253186137080421954" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9ZlWgYI/AAAAAAAAATg/SFM02DFZwlE/s1600-h/cg08.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcQ9ZlWgYI/AAAAAAAAATg/SFM02DFZwlE/s320/cg08.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253186137376588162" /></a><br /><br />The final verse of the Zero Requiem. Rest in peace Lelouch. T_T<br /><br />Several of my favourite quotes from Code Geass:<br /><br /><blockquote><br /><br /><i>If the king doesn't move, then his subjects won't follow.</i><div style="text-align:right">Lelouch Vi Britannia</div><br /><i>The world won't change with pretty words alone</i><div style="text-align:right">Lelouch Vi Britannia</div><br /><i>If being powerless is evil, is having power justice? Is revenge evil? Can friendship coexist with justice?</i><div style="text-align:right">Lelouch Vi Britannia</div><br /><i>Those with power, fear us! Those without power, seek us! The world should be judge by us, The Order of the Black Knights. </i><div style="text-align:right">Lelouch Vi Britannia</div><br /><i>Will there be sacrifice? Yes and not just soldiers, but innocent bystanders, as well. Even so ... no ... because of that, I cannot stop. Even if I need to cheat and hurt others, I must persevere. To that end I must become carnage incarnate. I must spill yet more blood, so that the blood already spilt will not be in vain.</i><div style="text-align:right">Lelouch Vi Britannia</div><br /><br /><i>Inequality is not an evil. Equality itself is evil</i><div style="text-align:right">Emperor Charles Di Britannia</div><br /><i>Good and evil are simply different sides of the card</i><div style="text-align:right">Emperor Charles Di Britannia</div><br /></blockquote><br /><br />And the one I liked the most:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcaegvfB4I/AAAAAAAAATo/qg6BVp3lMmc/s1600-h/cg09.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/SOcaegvfB4I/AAAAAAAAATo/qg6BVp3lMmc/s320/cg09.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5253196601838471042" /></a><br /><br /><blockquote><i>Those who may shoot are only those who are prepared to get shot themselves</i><div style="text-align:right">Lelouch Vi Britannia</div></blockquote><br /><br />While Sunrise made everyone wonder whether Lelouch is still alive, I'm guessing this is the end of Lelouch legend. Even if he is still alive and travelling with C.C, the wars already ended. Anyhow, an OVA to wrap up everything would be great. <br /><br />All in all, Code Geass is a recommended watch for those who haven't watch it. The whole 2 seasons of Code Geass was very enjoyable to me.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
