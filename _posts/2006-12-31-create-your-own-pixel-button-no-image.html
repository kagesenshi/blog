Do you want a cool pixel button for your blog or website? Don't know how to handle image editing softwares such as GIMP/Photoshop? Or perhaps just plain lazy to create your own manually? If yes, <a href="http://www.lucazappa.com/brilliantMaker/buttonImage.php">this site</a> can help you. It automatically generate a pixel button based on the spec you gave to the generator. Its easy and simple. They even gave away its sourcecode!.<br /><br />This StumbleUpon button, <br /><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/stumbleit-1.png"/> <br />was created using the tool. (I couldn't find one that matches my taste from the official site, so I brew it myself)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
