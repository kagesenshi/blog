<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So I created yet-another-barcamp-spinoff. :-)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e8kigepfI68/TsoG1e0o5-I/AAAAAAAAA50/AUjnKb3UHvY/s1600/logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e8kigepfI68/TsoG1e0o5-I/AAAAAAAAA50/AUjnKb3UHvY/s1600/logo.png" /></a></div><br /><br /><b> What is CampusCamp</b><br /><br />In general , <a href="http://campuscamp.org/">CampusCamp</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">BarCamp</a> for educational institutions, targeting specifically the people inside the educational institution itself, such as undergraduates, postgraduates, staff, and lecturers. The goal is to get these people to start sharing whatever they know, love, or doing.<br /><br /><b> Whats the difference compared to normal BarCamps?</b><br /><br /><div>Not much. The only major difference is the target audience. CampusCamp target <i>only </i>members inside the educational institution itself. External audience are allowed to attend, however, only if the college allows it, and CampusCamp will limit the number of sessions available for talks given by external people.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The reason of the limit is so that we could give way for more talks by the members of the educational institutions itself. It is also to make it easier for the students who are organizing CampusCamp to handle the audience.<br /><br /></div><div><b> Goals of CampusCamp</b><br /><br /><div>CampusCamp primary goal is to nurture the culture of sharing inside educational institutions. By encouraging sharing, we hope give birth to local special interest groups, increase communication and relation between students and staff with regard to knowledge,&nbsp;who knows, probably we'll raise the average quality level of graduates and the college too.<br /><br /></div><div><b> CampusCamp, Free/Open Source Software &amp; Free Culture Movements</b><br /><br /></div></div><div>Considering CampusCamp idea comes from a FOSS person, its a deception to say that there are no FOSS agenda here. Through nurturing the culture of sharing inside colleges, we also hope that some the special interest groups which might got born through CampusCamp are related to FOSS in one way or another. We hope these people will be the new groups of contributors in the FOSS world and ecosystem, increasing the amount of contributors in this region.<br /><br /></div><b> First CampusCamp @ Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS</b><br /><div><br />The very first CampusCamp was held last Saturday (19th Nov 2011) at <a href="http://www.utp.edu.my/">Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS</a>. It was a trial run for the team who are inside that college, so its was a small poorly promoted event. We managed to get 15 attendees &nbsp;which consist of a group of students, a group of alumni, and interestingly, 1 technician, with 8 talks presented.</div><div><br /></div><div>It was a good trial run and the team seems to kind of get the hang of it now. The next CampusCamp UTP is tentatively scheduled on February or March 2012.<br /><br /></div><b> Organizing your own CampusCamp</b><br /><div><br />Anybody can organize a CampusCamp. Our logo, name an format are open for anybody to use as long as it&nbsp;follow the spirit of CampusCamp and BarCamp.
