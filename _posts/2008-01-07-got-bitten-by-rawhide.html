title: Got bitten by rawhide
---

Yesterday i tried installing <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-test-list/2007-December/msg00494.html">Fedora Rawhide KDE4 20071220</a> as I was thinking switching to rawhide early this time.. The liveCD appears to work so i proceeded to the installation<br /><br />Guess what .. Rawhide eats me right after installation .. I cant login in X .. seems like everytime Xorg resets, modechange, or quits, the whole computer locks up.. <br /><br />Several changes I noticed from the rawhide liveCD:<br /><ul><li>Theres a Encrypt option in anaconda</li><li>I can't login as root on init 3 !! .. Why does Fedora follow Ubuntu on this sudo nonsense??? - wonder what will happen if i decided to install a minimal package set of command line stuff without firstboot .. that gonna be ugly.. but let wait and see how Fedora handles this.. perhaps sudo will only be enforced from liveCD install</li></ul><br />Now I'm back to the safe side with Werewolf. I will give Rawhide another shot when theres another rawhide spin or after F9-alpha is released. Hope Xorg doesn't eat me again that time.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
