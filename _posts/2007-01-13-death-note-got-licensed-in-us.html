<a href='http://www.viz.com/news/newsroom/2007/01_deathnote.php'><br />Read It Here</a><br /><br />I was wondering why it took so long for ep 13 of Death Note, so I googled and found out the news. Dammit, the US licensed the anime but us in non-US countries who suffered. <br /><br />Meanwhile, at the other side of the world, <a href='http://animanda-subs.blogspot.com/'>Animanda</a> fansubs have agreed with Death-Notes.com to continue subbing Death Note.　よかった。<br /><br />(^-^) Anxiously waiting for the next episode.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
