i came back to utp yesterday, and to my surprise the room i registered got somebody else staying in it. Due to that, i had to go through quite a hassle trying to get a new room to stay, sadly, only managed to get a room at the old residential village. *sigh*<br /><br />Guess i'll be serving that old village for another 1 semester .. *sigh*<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
