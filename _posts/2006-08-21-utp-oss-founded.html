tt has been quite some time since my last post, lots of thing happened.<br /><br />Last few weeks, i forwarded MyOSS's email about the PC-Fair to some of my lecturers, my first intention is juz to maybe make help on with the PC-Fair booth.... but sumthing else happened .. (shucks)<br /><br />The head of ICT/BIS Department - Dr.　Kamil - contacted me and ask me to create an Open Source Club in UTP!!!　(EEEK!!!). huhu ...<br /><br />It took me quite some time to decide whether to really put an effort to it because i'm not that good when it comes to management stuff.. but last week, on the ICT/BIS Dean List Award ceremony .. Dr. Kamil indirectly "shoot" at me during his speech (DARN!!　I'M NOT PREPARED FOR THIS!!) and on the stage - while giving my certificate - asked me to meet him as soon as possible with a group of ppl for the club .. (GEEZZ)..<br /><br />After the event, i quickly go back to my room, and asked #linux UTPchat for help ... gladly .. we got 8 ppl interested to become the first batch of members ...<br /><br />We went to meet Dr. Kamil on the next day .. the meeting was ok ... and he requested us to hold at least an event about opensource on this semester ...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
