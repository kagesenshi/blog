While watching Death Note ep13 (thanks Animanda!) I realized that I can translate my name to Japanese name. Got the idea from Yagami Light's name. The word Light in his name is spelled as 月(Tsuki) but pronounced as "Light". <br /><br />Feeling curious how my name will be in Japanese, I fired up <a href='http://edu.kde.org/kiten/'>Kiten</a> and start hunting down words that can match with the meaning of my name.<br /><br />Malays doesn't have first and last name system. We just use our given name followed by our father's name at the end as our full name. So, I decided to take out 2 words in my name and make it my first and last name :P<br /><br />Mohd Izhar Firdaus Ismail - I omitted my father's name and the first word of my name because both are names of ancient Phophets which doesn't have a direct literal meaning. That left me with Izhar Firdaus. <br /><br />Firdaus - literally means Eden/Heaven. From what I already know from learning Japanese, Heaven's kanji is 天 (Ama). Make it a family name it became 天野 (Amano)<br /><br />Izhar - literally means Bright/Clear. Using Kiten, I tried to find names that means bright/clear and I got a list of kanji that have similar meanings. Akira, Kazumi, Kira, Saya, Sayaka, Asu, are some of them. From the list I picked up Hikaru from the kanji 晃 (Akira/Hikaru/Aki). Reason?. Erm .. err ... 日+光=晃　Theres something in that combination that makes me like it. I simply don't know how to explain.<br /><br />From Izhar Firdaus , I got 天野晃 (Amano Hikaru) for my name ... 嬉しい〜！<br /><br />OpenSource apps surely have lots of fun use.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
