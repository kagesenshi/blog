I believe some of us have heard about <a href='http://insitu.lri.fr/metisse/'>Metisse</a> desktop environment thats going to be provided by  Mandriva  to their users. Metisse is quite an old project (since FC1) but havent had any major release until recently. Metisse is designed with usability in mind rather than funky effects - a product of the team's research on Human Computer Interaction subject. It won't make shiny effects but it might help you (and grandmas) to use computer and the desktop easier. <a href='http://insitu.lri.fr/metisse/screenshots/'> See screenshots here</a><br /><br />If you're interested with it, theres still no Metisse 0.4 packages for distros other that Mandriva thats has been out in the public yet. However, you can  build it from source by following this <a href='http://insitu.lri.fr/metisse/docs/building.html'>Howto</a>.<br /><br />Sadly, It uses a modified Xserver (rather than available compositing from AIGLX/XGL) which immediately turned me off. I don't like polluting my system with from-source installations that might be hard to remove later.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
