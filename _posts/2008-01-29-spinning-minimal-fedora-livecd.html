title: Spinning a minimal Fedora LiveCD
---

I've been spending today trying to spin a minimal Fedora liveCD as a base for spinning various of other custom spins for easing future stuff, and for fun. The package list was based on <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/metapackages/ubuntu-minimal.html">Ubuntu-Minimal metapackage</a> dependencies (of course, with some modification) and I'm using Revisor 2.0.5-15.fc8 for building the CD from a kickstart file.<br /><br />The build went smoothly, however, it seems like I missed some dependency or something. When the liveCD boots, it complained during startup:<br /><br /><code>---------------------------------------------------------<br />WARNING: Requested /sbin/init binary does not exist on rootfs<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Dropping to a shell. Good luck!<br /><br />bash: no job control in this shell<br />bash-3.2#</code><br /><br />I have sysvinit in the kickstart and checking in the image file (after mounted them) /sysroot/squashfs.img/os.img/sbin/init is there.<br /><br />Anybody know what dependency I might be missing here?? I'm going to checkout the rescue CD afterward to figure it out, but would appreciate some help if someone have solved this problem before.<br /><br />After this one is working, I'm going to spin one based on freebsd 6.2 package selection ;)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Edit</span>: I forgot to point to the kickstart file : <a href="http://pastebin.ca/879232">http://pastebin.ca/879232</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
