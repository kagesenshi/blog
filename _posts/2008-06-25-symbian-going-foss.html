title: Symbian going FOSS?
---

Noticed this from <a href="http://ajaxxx.livejournal.com/59350.html">an aggregated post</a> in Planet Fedora by Adam Jackson - <a href="http://www.symbianfoundation.org/">Symbian Foundation</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>The Symbian Foundation will provide, manage and unify the platform for its members. Also, it will commit to moving the platform to open source during the next two years, with the intent to use the Eclipse Public License.</blockquote><br /><br />Pressure from <a href="http://code.google.com/android">Google Android</a>??. Change of heart??. Anyway, its still a good sign for FOSS world :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
