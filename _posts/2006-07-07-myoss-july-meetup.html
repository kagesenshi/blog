title: MyOSS July Meetup
---

Just returned from MyOSS July Meetup at SEACEM, Bangsar. The main topic for this meetup is the OLPC project (a.k.a MIT's USD$100 Laptop) presented by Jaya Kumar, an Embedded System Architect that works on the laptop's audio system.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/blog-uploads/olpc.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/blog-uploads/th_olpc.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /></div><br />We were presented with the working mainboard of the system (<i>i was expecting a full system preview, *sigh*</i> ). The system is powered by 3 processors (1 for applications, 1 for wi-fi, and 1 for graphic), using a 512 NAND memory for storage, and 128MB SDRAM. There are no display available yet because the display technology is still under development - so we connect it to a CRT display (<i>somebody forgot to bring a projector *lol*</i>). The system runs Linux (<i>well, what-da-ya-expect?</i>) with kernel 2.6.17. <br /><br />The system runs Xorg smoothly (<i>well, there is only an X-term there. So it SHOULD be smooth. hehe</i>). Mr Jaya Kumar shown us a presentation slide using Xpdf on the system, and played some videos using Mplayer to show the task the laptop capable of performing. From the demonstrations, the laptop performs quite well. <br /><br />Overall, the meetup was great!. We got to learnt a lot from the presentation because Mr. Jaya also touch about the technology behind LCD screen, some economics, ethics, and plenty of hillarious jokes. (<i>They even forgot to get a speaker for audio demonstration and we end up using a pair of headphones - and we can only hear some whispering from it :P .. hey! at least we know it works .. hehe</i> ). And the meetup ends with a usual 'mamak' session.<br /><br />Looking forward for the next meetup next month. Hey wait! The next meetup that i can attend will be on the next semester break *sigh*. <br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
