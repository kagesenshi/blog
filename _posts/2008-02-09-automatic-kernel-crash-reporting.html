title: Automatic kernel crash reporting?
---

I updated to today's rawhide and rebooted. It boots but crashed when loading Xorg. Rebooted again and it back working. After login, a libnotify popup appeared (and I thought it was Xorg which fscked):<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/R613ElwGTSI/AAAAAAAAAOA/XZX_8Aih-zQ/s1600-h/20080209-01.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/R613ElwGTSI/AAAAAAAAAOA/XZX_8Aih-zQ/s320/20080209-01.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5164915268400860450" /></a><br /><br />There's another popup after sending to notify it successfully sent but I was too late to screenshot it as it disappears after a few second. Anyway, this thing is neat!. Finding data after a kernel crash is not something 'users' would do, but with these, upstream gonna have some good data to work with.<br /><br />Statistics are gathered at <a href="http://kerneloops.org">KernelOops.org</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
