Malaysian Election 2008 result is out.<br /><br />Barisan National got their ass seriously kicked!!. <br /><br />They won simple majority at Parliament, and loses a bunch of states. DAP leading bigtime with Penang and Selangor seats majorly won by them. <br /><br />With this result, lets see in this coming years, will BN will start fixing themselves? Will the Oppositions start seeing the real economics condition of Malaysia from the eyes of Parliament? How this will affect the stability of Malaysia? Can BN be able to find what's wrong with their organization? Can the Oppositions deliver their promises? Will the hidden voice within BN will raise and start reforming the party?<br /><br />Will Change happens? to the better? or to the worse?<br /><br />Let the coming years be the benchmark.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
