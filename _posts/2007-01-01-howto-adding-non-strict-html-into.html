I have been trying to insert some javascript buttons into the Posts widget of the new Blogger engine. There are no predefined widgets provided by Blogger for this purpose, so, I opened the template's HTML to insert it. However, the task that I thought gonna be easy became a frustrating task because the engine requires strict XHTML coding in the template thus making everything a nightmare to pass the syntax checker.<br /><br />Struggling to insert the code, I discovered that the engine will parse any &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; entries into &lt; and &gt; of the generated code. So , I fire up gedit, paste the code, and do a search and replace for &amp; &lt; and &gt;, replacing them with &amp;amp; &amp;lt; &amp;gt; and pasted the new code into the template. The result is -&gt; Success!! -&gt; look at the stumbleupon button below :)<br /><br />Linux and BSD users can do this quickly on a text file by using sed.<pre>cat file|sed s/'\&'/'\&amp;amp;'/g|sed s/'<'/'\&amp;lt;'/g|sed s/'>'/'\&amp;gt;'/g<br /></pre><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
