meng in #fedora-my pointed me that there are several torrents which claims to be Fedora9 "Sulphur" Final ISO in several torrent sites. While I don't know how legit they are - and didn't bother to download since I've been on F9 since alpha, but here is a little warning for those who couldn't be patience and wait for official release.<br /><br />Until the official SHA1/MD5 sums for those ISO is officially released in <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">FedoraProject.Org</a>, its validity and security is doubted. It is possible for some people with malicious intent to inject a rootkit into that ISO, and make themselves able to take over your computer and data. It is not that hard to spin a rootkit'ed ISO considering revisor and friends are rather easy to use. If I remember correctly, it have happened before with a Fedora release and was mentioned somewhere.<br /><br />You have been warned, so, if you still couldn't wait for 3 days more, go ahead and search for the torrents and have fun cleaning up stuff if you got rootkit'ed  (^-^).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
