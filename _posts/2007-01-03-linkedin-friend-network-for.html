title: 'LinkedIn : A friend network for professionals'
---

I stumbled upon a url to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/"> this site </a> from an email in a mailing list. Being curious, I opened the site. At first glance, I thought it was yet-another-friend networking site like friendster and myspace, but I noticed theres something different with it. So, I click the site's <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=company_info&trk=ftr_abt">about page</a> and read it. <br /><br /><blockquote><br />LinkedIn is an online network of more than 8.5 million experienced professionals from around the world, representing 130 industries.<br /><br />When you join, you create a profile that summarizes your professional accomplishments. Your profile helps you find and be found by former colleagues, clients, and partners. You can add more connections by inviting trusted contacts to join LinkedIn and connect to you.<br /><br />Your network consists of your connections, your connectionsâ€™ connections, and the people they know, linking you to thousands of qualified professionals.<br /><br />Through your network you can:<br /><br />    * Find potential clients, service providers, subject experts, and partners who come recommended<br />    * Be found for business opportunities<br />    * Search for great jobs<br />    * Discover inside connections that can help you land jobs and close deals<br />    * Post and distribute job listings<br />    * Find high-quality passive candidates<br />    * Get introduced to other professionals through the people you know<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Its kindof interesting to me, so I joined it. Feel free to invite me into you linkedIn connections.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/kagesenshi"><img border="0" width="120" alt="View Mohd Izhar Firdaus Ismail's profile on LinkedIn" src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/btn_viewmy_120x33.gif" height="33"/></a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
