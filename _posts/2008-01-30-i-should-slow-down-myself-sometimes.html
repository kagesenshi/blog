title: I should slow down myself sometimes
---

Me, being myself, had just noticed from <a href="http://spevack.livejournal.com/44085.html">Max Spevack's post</a> about FUDCon video, that <a href="http://torrents.fedoraproject.org/">torrents.fp.o</a> have a collection of FUDCon videos from previous conferences.<br /><br />It's a habit of mine, where I would usually simply skip through stuff when I'm looking for something specific on a page (I love ctrl+f). I've dropped by at torrents.fp.o several times last year, grabbed the ISO torrent, and left without looking at anything. I didn't notice the Boston FUDCon vids torrent are at the bottom of the page. <br /><br />Deluge fired up, leeching away~!!<br /><br />(I don't have chance (and money) to goto the conferences, hope I'll get something useful out of these)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
