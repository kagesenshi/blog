His current project migrates open source solutions, with programs like Blender to a constantly developing 3D animation environment. Blender is a strong open source contender to mainstream programs such as Maya and Softimage. Armed with an Electronic Arts degree and deeply involved with Open Source Software (OSS) development since 1996, he presently dedicates himself to using open source as a tool for digital content creation. True to the spirit of OSS, he wants to share his experiences, insights and knowledge with everyone.<br /><br />======<br />When:<br />======<br /><br />Saturday, 20th March 2010<br /><br />======================<br />What - Meetup Agenda:<br />======================<br /><br />2:30pm - 2:45pm : Registration<br />2:45pm - 3:00pm : Opening by the organizer<br />3pm - 4pm : Talk<br />4pm - 4:30pm : Lightning Talks<br />4:30pm - 5:00pm: Breakout Session<br /><br />=====<br />Cost<br />====<br /><br />Free of charge (gratis)<br /><br />=======<br />Contact<br />=======<br /><br />Mohd Izhar Firdaus Ismail<br />izhar@foss.org.my<br />+60172792765<br /><br />======<br />Where<br />======<br /><br />iTrain (M) Sdn Bhd,<br /><br />Unit E-7-1, Block E, Megan Avenue 1, 189 Jalan Tun Razak, 50400 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia<br /><br />================<br />About the Meetup<br />================<br /><br />This meetup is possible due to the support and facilities provided by iTrain Sdn Bhd (<a href="http://www.itrain.com.my/">http://www.itrain.com.my/</a>)<br /><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=336078464210">Facebook RSVP of this event</a><br /><a href="http://foss.org.my/projects/meetups/march-2010">Full event details, including map</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
