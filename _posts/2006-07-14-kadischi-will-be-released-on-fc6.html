This is what i read from Fedora People blog<br /><blockquote><br /><b>Chitlesh Goorah wrote:<br /><br /></b>- We have a spec file for kadischi. We thought to push kadischi in Fedora-extras-development only (not Fedora Extras).<br />why ?<br />+<br />because if approved, we can see whether kadischi builds on x86_64,<br />since there isn't syslinux on ppc, kadischi won't build on ppc. I'll<br />try to find time to use grub instead.<br />+ perhaps we could have more contributors and testers. Till now, only Jasper and I are working on Kadischi.<br />+ this will make us work harder and know what is failing and on what to work on.<br /><br />Do share with us your views about it.<br /><br />But, yes there is a but, the GUI we have for kadischi in CVS isn't ready at 100%. DamienDurand proposed to work a python glade version of it.Once ready, we may push kadischi to Fedora-extras-development.<br /><br /><a href="http://clunixchit.blogspot.com/2006/07/kadischi-some-updates.html">http://clunixchit.blogspot.com/2006/07/kadischi-some-updates.html</a><br /></blockquote><br /><br />After kadischi is released, there will be a much more easier way to create liveCD. No more of this messy chroot and manual clean-ups. <br /><br />However, from my experience using kadischi CVS a few months ago, i dont really like the all-automated-create-livecd-to-iso stuff. It didnt give me some space to do some manual tuning on the liveCD. Hope they will develop this sooner<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
