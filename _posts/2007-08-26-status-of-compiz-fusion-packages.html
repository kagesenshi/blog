I noticed Adel Gaddlah ( drago01 ) have submitted several compiz-fusion packages for review in BZ. He already pushed compiz-bcop into rawhide and in the process of getting the fusion plugins reviewed<br /><br /><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=253692">#253692</a> Review Request: compiz-fusion - Collection of Compiz Fusion plugins for Compiz<br /><a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=253693">#253693</a> Review Request: compiz-fusion-extras - Additional Compiz Fusion plugins for Compiz<br /><br />With this semester seems like its gonna be a busy semester, guess I'll just leave the fedora submission & maintaining to him.. hope the packages will get into fedora before the feature freeze .. <br /><br />On a sidenote .. i just noticed <a href="http://hendrik.kaju.pri.ee/screenlets/">screenlets</a> now have 0.0.10 release available .. and it now works with Fedora (the older release doesnt work because Fedora's DBUS version was too new for it). I'll package it when I have time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Future</span><br />I'm currently mirroring rawhide into my LAN server and planning to switch from F7 to rawhide when its done. Once compiz-fusion 0.5.2 gets it way into Fedora, i'll drop it from my repository and will start packaging compiz(-fusion) 0.6.0. Compiz 0.6.0 now requires XCB which, if i'm not mistaken, is not available for F7 and earlier.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
