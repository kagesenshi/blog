title: Zope/Plone on Fedora
---

My <a href="http://blog.kagesenshi.org/2008/01/month-with-freebsd-zope-and-plone.html">industrial internship</a> with <a href="http://www.inigo-tech.com/">Inigo Technologies</a> requires me to run a distro which have python2.4. Being someone who prefer to stick on RPMS rather than source-based installation, I ran CentOS on Xen of my home fileserver for Zope/Plone support.<br /><br />While wasting my time browsing through pirut a few days ago, I noticed compat-python/compat-zope/compat-plone on Livna repository. I know those packages exist by Jonathan Stefan, but didn't know that its on Livna. Anyway, cool, now I can play with zope on my laptop directly :D.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
