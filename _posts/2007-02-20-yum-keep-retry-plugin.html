title: yum-keep-retry plugin
---

This is my first try to write something useful using python .. so, please tell me if something not right with this plugin ..<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Functionality</span><br />This plugin add a retry download functionality to yum when download errors happen. Those that got a fast and stable internet seldom get download timeout/checksum/no more mirrors error, but theres a lot of ppl in 3rd world n developing countries have slow/unstable internet and timeouts sometimes occurs too frequently. I wrote this plugin to make yum retry downloading for a few more times before die.<br /><br /><a href='http://lists.dulug.duke.edu/pipermail/yum-devel/attachments/20070220/dc8e3550/keep-retry.py'>keep-retry.py</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
