title: Getting Flash Player 9 BETA
---

If any of you are still sticking with the old Flash Player 7 , I think it almost time to upgrade yourself now. Flash Player 9 BETA for linux have been released for quite a while already, and they also have released a standalone player for it. <br /><br />The installation step is simple .. just go to http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer9.html and download the tarball .. extract it .. and copy libflashplayer.so to ~/.mozilla/plugins .. restart your browser and ure done ..<br /><br />I know .. its sumthing that a little bit too easy for those geeks out there (its clearly stated in the readme on how to do it) .. I'm kindof out of idea on what to write though .. *sigh*<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
