hurm .... trying hard to restart blogging .. been quite occupied recently and been procrastinating on blog for quite a long time .. <br /><br />Anyway, here's some updates on what i've been working on and a rough summary on stuff i've discovered/learnt:<br /><br /><b>Work/Biz</b><br /><br /><a href="http://www.inigo-tech.com">Inigo Consulting</a> is growing slowly and steadily. We're getting better in our specialization stack : Plone, Zope3, Component Architecture. We're discovering lots of new ways to be efficient and modular in coding stuff in Python by utilizing the tools and libraries from the Zope Toolkit and stuff developed by the communities surrounding Zope. (eg: <a href="http://www.buildout.org/">buildout</a>, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.component">zope.component</a>, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.schema">zope.schema</a>, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/grokcore.component">grokcore.component</a> ) by utilizing them for non-zope stuff. Learning new ways to package and maintain python eggs, unittest, by utilizing buildout and a number of buildout recipes out there.<br /><br />Recently I've been helping out with <a href="http://www.startifact.com">Startifact</a> / Martijn Faassen and learned quite a lot of stuff from the work I did for him, mainly in Grok, Javascript and JQuery. Which are fun too.<br /><br />Inigo also just got our first office around last month, and we're doing some fun experiments in our local network. I started to poke on KVM Virtualization for serious deployment in our local office network and discovered some interesting stuff it can do - such as <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">virtio</a>, <a href="http://spice-space.org/">spice</a>, and also some annoying limitations of it (eg: bad IO performance for non-Linux, non-Windows OSes, eg: FreeBSD). Also poked around with automatic DHCP DNS, selective DNS forwarding between our nameserver in datacenter and our nameserver in office, automatic DNS for VPN connected machines, a bit of LDAP, and also setting up a wireless router using a server using hostap. Those are the already implemented stuff, as for (near) future stuff, we're planning to deploy Kerberos internally, setup a <a href="http://buildbot.net">buildbot</a> infrastructure for testing python eggs, and probably a <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> VM cluster for testing user interaction. Those gonna be fun too I believe.<br /><br /><b>Fedora</b><br /><br />Nothing much I've been doing in Fedora land recently however, just the typical desktop stuff, and not much ambassadorial work recently because I'm mainly on Python land nowadays. But anyway, with this new office Inigo have, we are now ready (and happy) to host event/sprints for the Fedora-My and local Python community ^.^ .<br /><br />Considering Fedora 14 release is coming near. To all Fedora users who are reading this blog and located in Malaysia. I have an announcement to make.<br /><br />A release party is going to happen NEXT WEEK at Inigo!!. I'll post more details in my next post ^.^<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
