New looks for a new year .. :P<br /><br />Actually, i got annoyed with the old theme where the main section is not wide enough to be comfortable with. Especially when the blog post is long. <br /><br />So, I decided to google for some new blogger theme and decided to pick this : <a href="http://bloggertemplates.itmag.org/2007/11/blogger-template-underground.html">http://bloggertemplates.itmag.org/2007/11/blogger-template-underground.html</a>. After some hack around and tweaking to my taste, the result is what you see now.<br /><br />Comments whether this theme better/not than the previous theme are appreciated.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
