title: Fedora Activity Day Malaysia 2009 - MSC Malaysia Open Source Conference 2009
  Event Report
---

A bit late for an event which happened last week, <br /><br />Here goes..<br /><br />31st May to 3rd June mark the date of the first MSC Malaysia Open Source Conference. The event gathered together a large number of local IT executives and developers in a packed 4 days event filled with lots of FOSS related talks and side events. Fedora Malaysia team was invited to get involved in the event, and naturally, we accepted and and 31st May mark the date of Fedora Malaysia team's first Fedora Activity Day!. <br /><br />It all started as simply an event where Fedora-My will be getting a kiosk booth and a room space - shared with Ubuntu-My, OpenSuSE-My, MyBSD, and other local communities - for an install party. But the involvement by Red Hat APJ as a platinum sponsor of the event changed the direction for Fedora-My. <br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5TopumiZI/AAAAAAAAAeA/RsIClyQfaJQ/s1600-h/FAD2009-04.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 213px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5TopumiZI/AAAAAAAAAeA/RsIClyQfaJQ/s320/FAD2009-04.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345301765596547474" /></a><br /><br />As a platinum sponsor, Red Hat was given a room on 31st May (which was an open / free-to-access day for the event) to do any activity they wished. Great thanks to Harish Pillay and crew from Red Hat APJ, that room was given to Fedora-My for our first Fedora Activity Day!. <br /><br />Harish and crew brought along some nice Freedom Infinity Voice banners for the event, and sponsored the large number of Fedora T-Shirts which we gave away to the crowd. Big thanks to the Red Hat crew :D. <br /><br />FAD-My 2009 was held in a conference-like style where our local team gave several talks related to Fedora, Fedora features and FOSS in general. Here was the schedule of the last FAD. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5MbrI4B7I/AAAAAAAAAc4/_YSTJ4IKFaE/s1600-h/FAD2009-01.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5MbrI4B7I/AAAAAAAAAc4/_YSTJ4IKFaE/s320/FAD2009-01.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345293846055487410" /></a><br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%"><tr><th>Topic</th><th>Time</th><th>Speaker</th></tr><tr><td>Fedora Electronic Lab (FEL) Overview</td><td>1030-1100</td><td>Mohd Syafarul Razi</td></tr><tr><td>Fedora Live USB</td><td>1100-1145</td><td>Shahriman Samsudin</td></tr><tr><td>How to get involved in Fedora Project</td><td>1200-1230</td><td>Mohd Izhar Firdaus Ismail</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><center>Lunch Break</center></td></tr><tr><td>KVM Virtualization as easy as 123 in Fedora</td><td>1345-1415</td><td>Syamsul Anuar Abd Nasir</td></tr><tr><td>SE Linux in a nutshell</td><td>1415-1500</td><td>Eric Yeoh</td></tr><tr><td>RPM Packaging HOWTO</td><td>1500-1545</td><td>Mohd Izhar Firdaus Ismail</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><center>Tea Break</center></td></tr><tr><td>Jboss: What the fuss is all about?</td><td>1600-1645</td><td>Muhammad Shuhir Idris</td></tr><tr><td>Closing remarks</td><td>1645-1730</td><td>Harish Pillay</td></tr></table><br /><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5My-u3rZI/AAAAAAAAAdA/aqHGW_9AamE/s1600-h/FAD2009-02.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5My-u3rZI/AAAAAAAAAdA/aqHGW_9AamE/s320/FAD2009-02.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345294246452112786" /></a><br /><br />The turn out was amazing, we had more than 50 attendees in the event (not sure the exact number, some said it reached 80) and the respond from the crowd was great too. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5Pmt0BviI/AAAAAAAAAdI/3hGZezCpgwE/s1600-h/FAD2009-03.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/Si5Pmt0BviI/AAAAAAAAAdI/3hGZezCpgwE/s320/FAD2009-03.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5345297334286794274" /></a><br /><br />Last but not least, thanks to all who have been involved in the FAD especially Harish Pillay and Red Hat APJ for sponsoring swags, the room, and the whole conference itself. Without that support , the event won't be as successful. <br /><br />To fellow Fedora-My comrades and Fedora users in Malaysia, this is not the end of stuff. More stuff will be coming from us in the near future, so stay tuned :D.<br /><br /><i>Pictures credits to <a href="http://www.sumardi.net">SuMarDi</a></i><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
