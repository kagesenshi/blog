A shocking thing happened yesterday morning , suddenly I couldnt connect to any sites and the router's lights remain static. Rebooting it and pushing the reset button doesnt help. After tens of times trying to get it back running, nothing seems to work. So, my conclusion, this guy just died. T_T . The router have been showing problems since a few weeks ago, it keep freezing and I had to restart it to get it back running. I guess , that was its message to me that its dying.<br /><br />So, today, a trip to lowyatt to get a new modem/router. <br /><br />Just bought a Linksys WRT54G Router and a ZyXel Prestige 650M ADSL modem and they cost me - RM279 (~USD80). Now I'm back online (with a hole in my wallet) and will continue packaging compiz fusion every few days (well .. guess not today .. I'm damn tired right now, plus I want to play with my new router .. lol).<br /><br />Also, I have contacted the compiz and beryl Fedora package maintainers, and will be working on with their guidance to improve the package for inclusion. Though I had a feeling it wont be until OpenCompositing.org release their first official tarball. Anyway .. its always better start stuff early, isnt it?. <br /><br />-away-<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
