I believe that they are *fundamental* truths of the Fedora project.<br /><br />1. It's not always easy to be true *free software* advocates. We take the good with the bad.<br /><br />2. The people we care most about are people who care about advancing the best of *free software*.<br /><br />3. Ubuntu is already catering to users who are willing to sacrifice freedom for the sake of *marginal* usability advantage. There's really no reason for us to follow them down that path. Will it cost us users? It certainly will. But we are *extremely* competitive with Ubuntu when it comes to *contributors* -- and it's *contributors* who change the world.<br /><br />Let Spaceman worry about being popular. Let's concern ourselves with being right, and being productive -- even when it's difficult.<br /><br />"Fedora -- Ubuntu's more responsible older brother."<br /><br /></blockquote><br /><br />Truly is!. <br /><br />This is what I usually do -&gt; Typical users, I usually point them to Ubuntu - saved me from trouble trying to explain something they might not be able to understand. But for brave users and potential contributors, I usually try to bring them to Fedora - Try helping them develop their skills, and hopefully they will give back something to Fedora, but more importantly, to the FOSS world. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/R8BNHVwGTTI/AAAAAAAAAOI/AXL9zx_zZGg/s1600-h/fedora-postit.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0DENAyCRujw/R8BNHVwGTTI/AAAAAAAAAOI/AXL9zx_zZGg/s320/fedora-postit.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5170217160714636594" /></a><br />Credits to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/NicuBuculei">Nicu</a> for this <a href="http://nicubunu.blogspot.com/2008/02/i-3-fedora.html">lovely artwork</a><br /><br />^-^<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
