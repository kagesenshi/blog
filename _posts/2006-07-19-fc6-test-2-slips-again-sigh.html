title: FC6 Test 2 Slips again *sigh*
---

<blockquote><b>From FedoraNEWS.org<br /><br /></b>With the update to a 2.6.18-rc based kernel, Xen requires some more<br />effort to get to working. Given that Xen is one of the big features for<br />Fedora Core 6, trying to ship the second test release (and thus the<br />feature freeze) without Xen seems like a less than ideal situation.<br /><br />Therefore, after discussion within the Fedora Board, we have decided to<br />slip the freeze for test2 until Xen is working again with current.<br /></blockquote><br />*sigh* I was really looking forward to FC6T2 and hoping it'll be distributed today. Hope&nbsp; this slip wont be long. My holiday is coming to an end this week.<br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
