<p>cmospwd this is a cool software that can view the CMOS password of a certain computer without the need of hacking into the hardware of the system ...</p>    <p>using it is damn easy ... juz simply run "ioperm.exe -i" as administrator . then run the cmospwd executable ... it will display the passwd to you ... i've tested it on my system with award bios 6.0 ... guess what .. it works with charm ... </p>    <p><a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/index.html?cmospwd.html">http://www.cgsecurity.org/index.html?cmospwd.html</a> </p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
