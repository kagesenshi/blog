I browsed through <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/">Lotus Symphony</a> website just now, just to check out what new in Lotus Symphony as the first and the last time I used it was during its alpha stage. <br /><br />One thing great that I noticed, a whole gallery of templates in ODF Template format!!! <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/gallery.jspa">http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/gallery.jspa</a>. Stuff ranging from document templates to presentation designs and cliparts. And due to it uses the ODF Template format, I can open them in no problem on OpenOffice. And I thought, "Great!, some free templates to use, but, what these are licensed on?".<br /><br />Looking at the <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/termsofuse.jspa">term of use</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Content from this Web site that is not provided under an agreement, such Content is not provided as "public domain"; you may use such Content for your personal, non-commercial use only and only in connection with your use of Lotus Symphony.</blockquote><br /><br />Erm, ain't that defeat the purpose of providing business document templates (invoice, meeting, project status, reports, sales plan, etc), but in the same time restrict the template to non-commercial?.<br /><br />IANAL, but the phrase "only in connection with your use of Lotus Symphony" sounds like I'm also prohibited to use these on OpenOffice (or any other ODF editor) on stuff unrelated to Lotus Symphony.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
