I guess everyone noticed that Firefox in Linux does not auto update using its update engine, and you'll need to use yum, apt, emerge, etc to update it. This is due to the reason that firefox from distribution packages is made to be installed into as read-only to the users. You can *fix* this problem by installing firefox into your home folder. By doing this, it allows firefox to be overwritten and make the update work. It worked for my Firefox2 on FC6.<br /><br />You can read my guide in installing apps in your home folder <a href="http://kagesenshi.blogspot.com/2006/12/organized-way-to-install-programs-you.html">here</a><br /><br />as for me , I install firefox in ~/local/opt/firefox2 and a symlink to the firefox startup script in ~/local/bin<br /><br />Btw, if you are using a compositing manager (eg. compiz/beryl ), you might need to add these two lines into the firefox startup script - right after the GPL notice - to keep firefox from crashing when opening sites with Adobe Flash<br /><pre>XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1<br />export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS</pre><br /><br />G'luck and enjoy~ :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
