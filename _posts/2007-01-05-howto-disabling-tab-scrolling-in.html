Firefox 2 introduces tab scrolling feature similar to Epiphany and several other browsers. However, while this feature seems to help stop tabs from becoming too small and hide its title, its considered annoying to some users. Not be able to see all of the tabs in once glance might not be preferable to some.<br /><br />To disable this, goto <a href="about:config">about:config</a> and set this<br /><pre>browser.tabs.tabMinWidth = 0</pre> Now your tabs can shrink until 0 pixel!! lolz!!.
