title: 'Missing in Fedora''s Menu: hal-device-manager'
---

At the UTP opensource lab i noticed theres a utility in ubuntu that shows all devices in a very informative way (at least for me), the hal-device-manager. After playing around with it a little bit, i started to wonder if there is one for Fedora. So, google away~. Juz after less than 2 minutes googling, i saw the RPM for the tool is hal-gnome, ey wait! I do have that installed in my box!. Immediately i fire up the console, typed <i>hal-device-manager</i> and hit enter.&nbsp; There it goes, its there all along with fedora but hidden from users' knowledge. まったく, Fedora should at least put that shortcut somewhere. The informations shown by that program is very usefull if you wanted to strip down your kernel bcoz it shows most of the drivers used by the system.<br /><br /><div align="center"><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/blog-uploads/060728-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://s3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/blog-uploads/th_060728-1.jpg" /></a><br /></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
