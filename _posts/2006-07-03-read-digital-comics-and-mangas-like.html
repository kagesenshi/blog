JPG comics are becoming more common in the internet, especially for FanSub'ed Japanese mangas. Usually these comics comes in zip archive and reading it will need the reader to uncompress the file and open one by one of the pages, often quite tedious to manage. Comical is a very convenient software for reading this type of comic. It can open a comic directly as a zip file, view the comic in either 1 pane or 2 panes, and even set the reading order for it - left to right, or right to left. <em>I've been using this since FC4 and really satisfied with it</em><br /><div align="center"><br /><a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/blog-uploads/0307-01.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y69/kagesenshi/blog-uploads/th_0307-01.png" border="0"/></a><br /></div><br />Get it at <a href="http://comical.sf.net">http://comical.sf.net</a>.
