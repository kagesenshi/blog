title: Life as a Linux/Unix admin in a Windows world - PT1 The experience
---

nice article about a life os a Linux/UNIX Admin .... i got the link from digg.com ..<br /><br />I like this extract from the article ... it reminds me on how stupid the IT Management Services of my university, Petronas Technology University.<br />The Dumb-asses<br />OK, so a good Linux/Unix Admin will be jack of all trades when it comes to the computer world. Most will have some basic knowledge of just about everything. I want to explain a situation I ran into a few years back that made my jaw drop and got me so freaking frustrated.<br /><blockquote><br />We lost power, and I came in along with our Windows Admin at the time to check in on a 2 servers that didn't come up automatically. One Windows and one FreeBSD.<br /><br />Windows Admin goes to his and to his surprise the Windows machine is going in reboot loop. BIOS, OS start, reboot, BIOS, OS start reboot etc, basically a file system error occurred that was fixed by booting into safe mode and running scan disk I believe.<br /><br />So we go to my machine and its hung at the BIOS level. I turn it off and turn it back on, same thing. Right after the memory count, and before the SCSI initialization it hard locks. Hrmm, that's weird. I show Windows Admin who laughs at me. This is how the conversation went:<br /><br />Win Admin: Damn unstable Linux, if that thing was running Windows you would of been able to easily fix it.<br />Me: Huh (keep in mind, this guy has A+ certification so he should know how a computer works)<br />Win Admin: System won't even start to boot, Linux really bit the dust that time ha ha.<br />Me: Hey smart guy, you are aware that it hasn't even tried to touch the Master Boot Sector?<br />Win Admin: Like I know that Linux crap, you don't have to worry about that crap in Windows.<br />Me: OMG (I start laughing).<br />Win Admin: Whats so funny?<br />Me: Let me get this straight, your A+ certified correct?<br /><br />I then go on to explain that the issue is not a OS, but at the hardware level. And I also taught him what the master boot record was.<br /><br /></blockquote><a href="http://linuxgangster.org/modules.php?name=Content&file=viewarticle&amp;id=19">http://linuxgangster.org/modules.php?name=Content&file=viewarticle&amp;id=19</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
