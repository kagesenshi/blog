title: UTPchat Servers In V1/V4/V5 are up
---

To UTP students, our UTPchat IRC network is now back functional in Village 1, 4 and 5. The servers have been linked up and connected with each other.<br /><br /><blockquote>Village 1 Server : (Togakure) 161.0.2.210<br />Village 4 Server : (Student) 164.0.2.210<br />Village 5 Server : (Soul) 165.0.4.210</blockquote><br /><br />There are some problem with V2 and V3, and we are still finding a way to resolve it.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br/>
