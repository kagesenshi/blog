For those who are looking for ways to how to undelete/recover lost files from a broken filesystem, <a href="http://www.sleuthkit.org/">The Sleuth Kit</a> is one option you have. It supports extracting files from NTFS, FAT(12,16,32), EXT(2,3), UFS(1,2), ISO9660, raw, and swap disks partitions. <br /><br />Discovered this tool in <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> 12 repository last night when my dad's friend's drop by at house and overheard he asked about how to recover data from his broken NTFS external HDD.
